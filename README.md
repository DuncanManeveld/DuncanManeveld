# Hi, I'm Duncan Maneveld 👋

### Aspiring Software Engineer

I am a passionate software developer currently strengthening my skills as a student at WeThinkCode. I have a strong interest in problem-solving and designing effective solutions, and I enjoy tackling challenges that require logical thinking and creativity.

My journey began with CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python and has continued with CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science, giving me a solid grounding in programming fundamentals, algorithms, and computational thinking.

* 🔭 I’m currently a student at **WeThinkCode_**, expecting my NQF6 Certificate in Software Engineering in 2025.
* 🌱 I’m deepening my expertise in programming and software development.
* 💬 Ask me about Python, Java, or fundamental computer science concepts.
* 📫 How to reach me: Duncanmaneveld@gmail.com
